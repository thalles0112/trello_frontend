front end of a web-app I am developing with ReactJS on frontend and Django as backend.
The app is much like Trello, it has cards, boards and lists. These are some of the features today:

- login page
- create boards
- boards can be shared with other people
- lists can be created and its name can be edited
- cards can be created and dragged to other lists and inside its own list
- rich text editor
- field to mention other people
- comments on cards
- creating and moving cards and lists is currently synced via websocket so anyone that
  is connected (or viewing the board) will see the changes happening.
 
 more functionalities will be added in the future.
